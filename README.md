# DijkstraMeetsUndirectedGraphs
Created this project for a course I'm taking on coursera. This is the first graph I've written, so it is special (expect some logical redundancies, I'm still picking up c++). For a private repository, I think it's okay to hide the nitty gritty details of how this program works inside the code itself. If you want to follow along, I suggest reading the comments in main, the ShortestPath and UndirectedGraph implementation files, as they're most revealing.
